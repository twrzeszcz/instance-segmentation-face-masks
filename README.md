# General Info
This is a instance segmentation project where we try to segment face masks using a *pixellib* package. Dataset was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). Since this is a segmentation and not a detection problem we had to use a *Labelme* software for labelling and getting bitmap masks. It was done only on the subset of images which are stored in the **face_masks** folder. Unused images and in the **train_unused** and **test_unused** folders. The entire process of training and inference is done in the **instance_segmentation** notebook. You can also find 2 trained models with a *resnet50* and *resnet101* backbone. Finally there are 3 videos taken from [mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/mask/) which were segmented using one of the models.
